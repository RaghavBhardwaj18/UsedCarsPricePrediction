# UsedCarsPricePrediction

This repository contains the code and resources for our mini project on predicting the prices of used cars listed on [Cars24.com](https://www.cars24.com). Our project utilizes web scraping, data preprocessing, and machine learning to build a predictive model that estimates the market value of used cars based on various attributes.

## Project Overview

**Web Scraping:** We used BeautifulSoup to scrape detailed car listings from Cars24.com, extracting key features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.
**Data Processing:** The scraped data was cleaned, preprocessed, and engineered to prepare it for machine learning modeling.
**Machine Learning:** A predictive model was built using various machine learning algorithms, trained to estimate car prices with high accuracy.
**Tools & Technologies:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Google Colab.

## Repository Contents

**Used Cars Prediction.ipynb:** Google Colab notebook containing the web scraping code and data extraction process.
**Price Prediction of Used Cars.pdf:** The final project report submitted as part of our coursework, outlining the entire process and findings.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CarPricePredictor.git`
2. Navigate to the desired notebook and open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the steps in the notebooks to replicate the web scraping, data processing, and model training.

## Results

Our model successfully predicted car prices with an excellent accuracy. We identified key factors influencing car prices and provided insights into the used car market.
